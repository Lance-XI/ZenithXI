 * This module implements fishing fatigue, which limits the number of fish
 * a player can catch in a day. The regular limit is 200 fish/items as
 * per retail, but is limited to 20 fish/items for new accounts until
 * they have reached a required rank in any of the three nations.
 *
 * The amount of fish caught is tracked in the player's char_vars, and
 * resets at JST midnight. We inspect the Fishing Minigame 2 Packet
 * (0x110) and check if minigame sends the ANIMATION_FISHING_CAUGHT
 * animation. If the character had hooked a small/big fish or an item
 * as well, we increase the char_var by 1.
 *
 * Limiting the fishing action is done by inspecting the Player Action
 * packet (0x01A) to see if the player is attempting a Fish Action (0x0E).
 * If the daily cap was reached, we set the lastCastTime to 600 seconds in
 * the future. This will cause the FishingAction to automatically fail
 * into CatchNothing. A message will be sent to the player informing them
 * the limit has been reached.
 *
 * This script will allow for players to resume fishing after Ranking
 * up their nation and changing zones, up to the new limit. Changing
 * Allegiance won't cause you to lose your unlocked 200 daily cap.
